# Turnout

Turnout is a full-stack web application inspired by Eventbrite and Meetup, allowing you to find and host exciting events. Turnout has a Rails backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React/Redux frontend. 

## Key Features

### Discovery 

Turnout is packed with a plethora of ways to discover new events. Users can browse events on the landing page with infinite scroll, click on event tags, click on event categories on the home page, or even use the built-in search feature to find events that suit their tastes. 

### Bookmarks

Users can bookmark events from nearly any place on the site, and view these events on their personal profile. Turnout is fully dynamic. Bookmark icons change color to indicate they've been saved, so users can continuously browse events while simultaneously saving events that are of interest to them.
